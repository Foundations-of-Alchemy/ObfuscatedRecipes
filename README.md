# OpenEasterEggsLib
Encrypted data/assets to prevent users from finding out secrets. 
This mod was made to hide recipes, items, etc. from the user, allowing mod devs to make truely hidden easter eggs.

Comes with a data-gen library. I would recommend making a datagen sourceset and gitignoring it.

# Current Features
  - encrypted recipes
    - crafting
    - smithing
    - stonecutting
  - encrypted textures
  - encrypted lang entries
  - api for adding your own features

**This was NOT made for paranoid artists/developers**\
If you're using this mod to make a closed source mod, the licence allows you to, but fuck you.
